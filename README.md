# Nextgen Food Court Web Application

A mobile-first food court ordering system for **Nextgen Mall**, Nairobi, digitizing food ordering and table booking across 20–30 cultural cuisine outlets under one unified platform.

## Introduction

A food court is an area within a shopping mall that offers a wide range of food options from different outlets. At **Nextgen Mall**, the current manual approach causes confusion, where multiple waiters approach customers simultaneously with menus.

**This application solves that problem** by allowing customers to view all available menus, place orders, and book tables in advance—directly from their smartphones.

## Problem Statement

Nextgen Mall’s food court is busy and culturally diverse, but the manual ordering system is inefficient and confusing. The goal is to digitize the customer experience, improve order management for outlets, and reduce crowding and order errors.
